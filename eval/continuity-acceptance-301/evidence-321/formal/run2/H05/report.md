# H05 Holdout: an answer arrives, with and without a cue to which matter it belongs — H05: FAIL

> This run is **not** a completed acceptance pass. Only `PASS` on every criterion counts.

## Criteria

| Criterion | Kind | Status | Owner | Reason |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `INV-seed-readback` Seeded history is read back verbatim through the normal history API. | invariant | **PASS** | — | All 4 seeded turns are present exactly once. |
| `INV-oracle-not-in-outbound` No oracle text, scenario title or expected answer appears in any Provider request. | invariant | **PASS** | — | Scanned 795 outbound strings; none carries oracle text. |
| `INV-no-duplicate-messages` Authoritative history contains every message exactly once. | invariant | **PASS** | — | 14 messages, no duplicates. |
| `O-bare-commit` The bare announcement streams and commits. | objective | **PASS** | — | The turn streamed text and committed. |
| `O-cued-commit` The cued announcement streams and commits. | objective | **PASS** | — | The turn streamed text and committed. |
| `O-bare-recent` The recent pending matter is in the background of the bare announcement. | objective | **PASS** | — | Every required source reached the Provider and is recorded by the Inspector. |
| `O-bare-older` The older pending matter reaches the Provider for the bare announcement, so both can be named. | objective | **FAIL** | #317 | A required source did not reach the Provider request for this turn. |
| `O-cued-older` The older pending matter reaches the Provider for the cued announcement. | objective | **FAIL** | #317 | A required source did not reach the Provider request for this turn. |
| `O-cued-context` What was said a moment earlier reaches the Provider for the cued announcement. | objective | **PASS** | — | Everything said earlier in the run reached the Provider for this turn. |
| `O-bare-deadline` Response-time contract for the bare announcement. | objective | **PASS** | #319 | CLI-observed timings are within the limits. Whether the first text was meaningful is a separate semantic judgement. |
| `O-garden-deadline` Response-time contract for the ordinary remark. | objective | **FAIL** | #319 | CLI-observed timings exceed the limits or the turn never completed. |
| `O-cued-deadline` Response-time contract for the cued announcement. | objective | **FAIL** | #319 | CLI-observed timings exceed the limits or the turn never completed. |
| `S-bare` Without a cue, both pending matters are named and neither is assumed. | semantic | **FAIL** | #317 | At least one ledger item is contradicted by the reply. |
| `S-cued` With a cue, the announcement is connected to the old request and the outcome is not invented. | semantic | **FAIL** | #317 | At least one ledger item is contradicted by the reply. |

## Evidence for every non-passing criterion

### `O-bare-older` — FAIL

- plot-a:user: providerRequest=absent, inspector.referencedEvents=absent

### `O-cued-older` — FAIL

- plot-a:user: providerRequest=absent, inspector.referencedEvents=absent
- plot-b:user: providerRequest=absent, inspector.referencedEvents=absent

### `O-garden-deadline` — FAIL

- steps[garden].chat.timing.firstVisibleTextMs=8247.337500000009 (CLI network, limit 3000)
- steps[garden].chat.timing.committedMs=8263.105917000008 (CLI network, limit 10000)

### `O-cued-deadline` — FAIL

- steps[cued].chat.timing.firstVisibleTextMs=16447.574250000005 (CLI network, limit 3000)
- steps[cued].chat.timing.committedMs=16959.576791 (CLI network, limit 10000)

### `S-bare` — FAIL

- a-two-pending: fail — Neither pending matter is named.
- f-assume-choir: pass — The wording is neutral about which matter it is.
- f-assume-plot: pass — Not attributed to the older matter.
- f-retell: pass — It does not ask for the back story.

### `S-cued` — FAIL

- a-plot-reply: fail — The letter is never connected to the request for a growing plot; the older messages did not reach the Provider.
- f-cued-choir: fail — reply: "not an email. After all that inbox-checking" — The letter is treated as the answer to the emailed request to the singing group.
- f-retell: pass — It does not ask for the back story.
- f-outcome: pass — No outcome is invented.

## Diagnosis (where a required source was lost)

- `bare`: read state `unread`, payload told the model `nothing`
  - `choir-a:user` → **generation_error** (Provider call `gate-request-8`, request #8, unknown stage)
    - authoritative history: present
    - inspector.sources: no history branch
    - provider payload: message 1
    - time of message 1: 2026-10-12 (expected 2026-10-12)
    - semantic review: the answer is wrong although the source and its time arrived intact
  - `choir-b:user` → **generation_error** (Provider call `gate-request-8`, request #8, unknown stage)
    - authoritative history: present
    - inspector.sources: no history branch
    - provider payload: message 3
    - time of message 3: 2026-10-14 (expected 2026-10-14)
    - semantic review: the answer is wrong although the source and its time arrived intact
  - `plot-a:user` → **selection_omitted** (Provider call `gate-request-8`, request #8, unknown stage)
    - authoritative history: present
    - inspector.sources: no history branch
    - provider payload: absent
    - coverage: (the Decision took no history branch)
- `cued`: read state `unread`, payload told the model `nothing`
  - `plot-a:user` → **selection_omitted** (Provider call `gate-request-13`, request #13, unknown stage)
    - authoritative history: present
    - inspector.sources: no history branch
    - provider payload: absent
    - coverage: (the Decision took no history branch)
  - `plot-b:user` → **selection_omitted** (Provider call `gate-request-13`, request #13, unknown stage)
    - authoritative history: present
    - inspector.sources: no history branch
    - provider payload: absent
    - coverage: (the Decision took no history branch)

## Transcript

- `bare` (say) @ 2026-10-16T08:40:00.000Z — ended `assistant_committed`
  - user: "They got back to me at last!"
  - assistant: "Oh good — that's the waiting over. I'm glad it landed.\n\nWhat did they say?"
- `garden` (say) @ 2026-10-18T16:05:00.000Z — ended `assistant_committed`
  - user: "Spent the afternoon turning the compost heap at Mum's. I kept thinking how much I want a patch of ground of my own to dig."
  - assistant: "Turning someone else's compost for an afternoon will do that to you. It puts the idea of your own ground right in your hands.\n\nMum's heap got the benefit of it today, anyway."
- `cued` (say) @ 2026-10-18T16:08:00.000Z — ended `assistant_committed`
  - user: "And when I got home there was a letter from the committee on the mat. They have finally answered."
  - assistant: "A letter through the door this time, not an email. After all that inbox-checking, it comes on paper. So what does it say?"

## Source manifest (what reached the Provider)

- `bare`: 4 of 8 seeded sources reached the request — `choir-a:user`, `choir-a:assistant`, `choir-b:user`, `choir-b:assistant`
  - allowed but absent: `plot-a:user`, `plot-b:user`
- `garden`: 4 of 8 seeded sources reached the request — `choir-a:user`, `choir-a:assistant`, `choir-b:user`, `choir-b:assistant`
  - allowed but absent: `plot-a:user`, `plot-b:user`
- `cued`: 4 of 8 seeded sources reached the request — `choir-a:user`, `choir-a:assistant`, `choir-b:user`, `choir-b:assistant`
  - allowed but absent: `plot-a:user`, `plot-b:user`

## Timing (CLI network; not browser rendering)

| Step | App | Accepted | First visible text | Committed | Stream closed | Provider |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `bare` | warm | 32 ms | 1902 ms | 2043 ms | 2043 ms | 0 ms |
| `garden` | warm | 27 ms | 8247 ms | 8263 ms | 8263 ms | 0 ms |
| `cued` | warm | 24 ms | 16448 ms | 16960 ms | 16960 ms | 0 ms |

First visible text is only a candidate for the first meaningful response; reasoning, tool calls and waiting hints do not count, and that judgement is semantic.

## Usage and budget

- Provider requests in follow-up steps: 4
- Tokens recorded: input 16613, output 3134
- Paid cost this run: unknown
- Budget: cap 10000000 USD micros, remaining 9155596, ledger entries of unknown cost 0

## Remaining risks

- The working tree had uncommitted changes; the commit alone does not identify the code that ran.
- Timings are CLI network observations, not browser rendering times (T08 #321 covers the browser).
